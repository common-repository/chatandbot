This plugin creates a live chat on your website to support your customers. There is a free plan without our brand for small businesses.

== Description ==

If you want to quickly answer customer questions then live chat is a necessary part of your website. If the site is created using WordPress, then this plugin will help you easily add the chat of the ChatAndBot service. 

If you have just launched your startup and you have few clients, then the free plan will help you organize support without extra costs.
